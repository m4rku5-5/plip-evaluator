# plip-evaluator

An evaluator module written in JAVA for the PLIP tool (developed by TU Dresden) to test capabilities for secondary structure prediction.
Currently testing against DSSP and HBPLUS (has to be compiled by your self). Maybe more to come.

Latest release contains all necessary things.

In cooperation with HS Mittweida.
